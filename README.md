# KMeans-Hierarchical-and-DBSCAN

In this notebook, i have tried to appy KMeans, Hierarchical and DBSCAN clustering along PCA. The dataset used is Mall_Customers. In DBSCAN, certain type of Heatmaps are used to find the Epsilon and min_samples value which have performed quite well in identifying the correct number of cluters.
